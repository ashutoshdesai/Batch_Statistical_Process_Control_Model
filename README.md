# Batch_Statistical_Process_Control_Model
Build a model from old batch data and monitor current batches for quality inspection

Batch Data Analysis: (Introduction)

In this problem, we will look into batch data; dynamic time-series of a finite duration 2. Batch manufacturing processes are very common in chemical, pharma, bioengineering and semi-conductor industries such as baker's yeast production, beer brewing and vaccines production.
In theory, a reactor is designed with temperature, pressure, level, pH control and multiple sensors that measure these variables among others. A perfect batch (again in theory) is one that is tightly controlled to the specifications and as a result the productivity and quality of the final product is optimized.
In real life, a typical batch is run from a few hours up to a week or two and a lot of things can go wrong during this period. There is always variability either because the process is very sensitive to minor fluctuations in some variables or the control of some variables failed for a period of time.

Key steps:

1. Build a Batch Statistical Process Control model
2. Use the model to monitor running batches
